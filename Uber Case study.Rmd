### General culture required: Weather and the different parameters used to measure it. 

## This case study talks about Uber pickups in the state of New York for a period of 6 months. Associated variables 
## are given which in our opinion describe what affects those pickups. 
## Dependent variable = pickups 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
getwd()

# import dataset
Uber=read.csv("Uber Dataset.csv")
attach(Uber)

head(Uber)
tail(Uber)
dim(Uber)
names(Uber)
```

## Our dataset seems to have been well imported. Now, we proceed with some exploratory data analysis to see what the
## data tells us about Uber pickups in the state of New York. Data collected is from 2015-01-01 to 2015-06-30. 

# EDA  
```{r}

# Check the structure of the dataset

## Our dataset contains 13 variables, 3 categorical and 10 numeric variables

# check missing data -  there are many boroughs which are missing from the data. 10.46% of boroughs that is, 3000 
# missing enteries which is quite significant. We need to take care of this.

### High level overview of data summary

## The wind speed varies from borough to borough. Some boroughs get very low wind speed and others get very high. 

## Road visibility by drivers ranges from 0 to 10 miles across boroughs

## The temperature across boroughs ranges from 2 to 89 degrees F across boroughs. 

## Dew point across boroughs ranges from -16 to 73 degrees F across boroughs.The higher the dew point rises, the greater the 
# amount of moisture in the air. This directly affects how "comfortable" it will feel outside.

## Sea level pressure ranges from  991.4 to 1043.4 across boroughs. low-pressure system moves into an area, it usually leads to cloudiness,
# wind, and precipitation. High-pressure systems usually lead to fair, calm weather. 

## Precipitation is rain, snow, sleet, or hail â€” any kind of weather condition where something's falling from the sky. In this dataset, it
# 3 variables for precipitation are measured, precipitation for 1h, 6h and 24h and we see how precipitation affects pickups across boroughs.
#  the forms of water particles, whether liquid or solid, that fall from the atmosphere (eg, rain, hail, snow or sleet). 

## Snow depth in inches has a range of 19 inches but differ across boroughs. 

## Within this 6 months period (180 days), 3.9% of the days were public holidays and 96.1% of the days were non public holidays. 

## There are significant amounts of missing boroughs from our data which need to taken care of. 

## There are observations which are very different from all other variables, otherwise known as outliers which need to taken care of.

## The variable Pickup_dt needs to be dealt with separately. We need to break it into its different components - Month, day, weekday and 
# these different components can show us what the state of pickups are within months, days of the month and weekdays. 


## High level summary of data
```{r}

# summary - data contains too many outliers  and this visual is not informative.
plot_boxplot(Uber,by="pickup_dt")

## Manhattan gets the most number of pickups followed by Broklyn and then Queens. On a high level, the weather factors affecting pickups
## seems to follow the same pattern
plot_boxplot(Uber,by="borough") 

# **************************************************************************************************************************************************************
plot_boxplot(Uber,by="pickups")

## Observations
## Pickups  increase as temperatures increase, implies weather gets better. So, when weather is not favourable, people order less.
## We see almost a similar trend with road visibility. Dew point seems to favor pickups, the more the dew point, the more the pickups.
## Positive correlation between pickups and sea level pressure (the higher the pressure, the better the weather)
## The higher the wind speed, the more the pickups. Thus, wind speed doesn't seem to affect pickups. 
# **************************************************************************************************************************************************************

## The lower the average wind speed, the higher the pickups

```
## Observations: 
# - Manhattan gets the most number of pickups followed by Broklyn and then Queens. 

## - Pickups  increase as temperatures increase, implies weather gets better. So, when weather is not favourable, people order less.
## - We see almost a similar trend with road visibility. Dew point seems to favor pickups, the more the dew point, the more the pickups.
## - Positive correlation between pickups and sea level pressure (the higher the pressure, the better the weather)
## - The higher the wind speed, the more the pickups. Thus, wind speed doesn't seem to affect pickups negatively. 
## - No clear trend with sea level pressure and pickups. 
## - The lower the median snow inches in a borough, the higher the number of pickups


## How to handle NA's 
```{r}
## This command sums the total number of NA's in any variables in our dataset
sapply(Uber, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))


# This code takes all the NA's and put them in a separate column in our borough variable
Uber$borough = as.factor(replace(as.character(Uber$borough), is.na(Uber$borough),"Unknown B"))
levels(borough)

## This code helps to confirm that the NA's column called "unknown" were successfully added as a 7th borough
table(Uber$borough) 

## This shows us graphically what our borough variable looks like after adding an unknown column to it
plot(aggregate(pickups~borough,data = Uber,sum),type="p")
plot(borough,pickups)

## See  https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/images/lines0.png for graph types other than "p" 

```
## Observations
## All the missing labels of boroughs were grouped and put in particular category. They weren't deleted because they were
## significant. Deleting them meaning deleting observations which in turn might affect out analysis negatively. 


# How to split the Date variable
```{r}
require(pacman)
library(lubridate)
p_load(lubridate)
p_load(dplyr)

# Let us break date into hour, day, month
Uber$start_date = strptime(Uber$pickup_dt,'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')

# We extract month, day, hour and week day from the newly created date so as to draw more insights at
# a granular level
Uber$start_month = month(Uber$start_date)
Uber$start_day = day(Uber$start_date)
Uber$start_hour = hour(Uber$start_date)
Uber$wday = weekdays(Uber$start_date)
Uber = Uber[,-14]
attach(Uber)

plot_boxplot(Uber,by="start_month")
plot_boxplot(Uber,by="wday")
```
## Observation: 
## - More pickups are experienced on weekends 

## Observation: 
## - 4 new variables have been created: "Start_month", "Start_day", "Start_hour", and "Wday"


## Univariate analysis  for categorical variables and the dependent variable 
```{r}

# Observation: All boroughs rate of pickups is the same with the exception of unspecified boroughs which vary and all these pickups
#       happen 96.1% of the time on non-pyblic holidays

# Two peaks culd be seen around 35 and second around 60 in the histogram

# Rememberr, all of these steps are just to look at how the data is behaving, information hunt!

# No snow for majority of times since the other peaks are way too low and pick is at point 0
# Thus, we think snow depth doesn't affect driving and peakups

### Check Pickups in Start_month to see the behavior

## lets see daily bookings of taxi in a month
plot(aggregate(pickups~start_day,data=Uber, sum), type="b", main ="Sum of bookings for each day")

## Observation: Some insights are revealed by the peaks of the graph, pickups were high at those places. 


## Here we exclude the month of february for Pickups and see what graph gives us
Uber %>% 
  filter(.,start_month !=2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=start_day, y=pickups))+geom_bar(stat='identity')


## Pickup on an hourly basis
plot(aggregate(pickups~start_hour,data=Uber, sum), type="b")
## Pickups are very high around the 19th-20th hour and then decrease steadily till 5am and we know why. 


## Pickups based on days of the week
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(wday, pickups), y = pickups), data = Uber) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=pickups), width=0.5, stat = "identity") + coord_flip()

### Get aggregate pickups for all boroughs of NY City
Uber$wday = as.factor(Uber$wday)

## low bookings on monday which rises till saturday and then drops off slightly on sunday


```
## Observation: 
# - There are 2 holidays in January, February, and May. There is 1 holiday in June and no holiday in March and April .
# - There are no holidays in the month's of March and April and hence no trips on those days. The highest number of trips
# - are recorded in March.

# Multivariate Analysis  (NOT NEEDED. It yields redundant information)
